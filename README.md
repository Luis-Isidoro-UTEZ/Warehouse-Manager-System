##  Description

This project provides a platform to manage the sale and rental of warehouses, developed as part of the Integrative Project course at UTEZ.
The main objective is to facilitate warehouse management for the administrators of each branch and for the super administrator. 

---

## Key Points to Consider:
- Only one administrator can manage a single branch, and a location may have no administrator.
- Each branch is in a specific geographical area, but every branch contains multiple warehouses.
